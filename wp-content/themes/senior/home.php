			<h2>One Of The Very Best Financial Planning Tools Available to Senior Homeowners Today!</h2>

			<div class="col-sm-7">
				<p>Thousands of Senior Homeowners are discovering the financial benefits of a reverse mortgage every month! By unlocking the equity in their home, for many seniors the reverse mortgage has become a dream come true! It really can create Senior Freedom!! There are so many retirement benefits associated with a reverse mortgage and the Reverse Mortgage process is straightforward! The primary lending criteria for qualification is that the youngest borrower on the mortgage must be at least 62 years old, the borrowers must have a history of making monthly installment payments on time, annual Housing obligations, and the borrowers have adequate income to cover living expenses and pay their annual taxes and homeowners insurance. The amount of money available is based on the age of the borrower, value of thehome, and selected interest rate!</p>
				<h2>Cash Flow! Like an Automatic Pay Raise!</h2>
				<p>For seniors who still owe money on their home, a Reverse Mortgage can eliminate their monthly mortgage payment! That means what used to be their mortgage payment every month turns into disposable income for their retirement! If you seniors are paying $950 every month on a mortgage, it's like getting an $11,500 annual pay raise! If they still owed 5 years on the mortgage, they would keep $57,500 in their pocket! They immediately free up that money for things needed in retirement. It's their's to spend any way they choose. Please note that the HECM reverse mortgage loan must be repaid with interest when the borrower dies, sells the home, moves out of the home, or defaults on other housing obligations such as insurance or taxes.</p>
